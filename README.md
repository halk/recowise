# RecoWise - An integration framework for recommenders

RecoWise is a framework to ease and standardise the integration of various recommendation engines to any host system.

This project is the main work of my [MSc project](https://github.com/halk/msc-project-report).

Since the MSc project is still ongoing, a proper README will be submitted until October.

See [recowise-vagrant](https://github.com/halk/recowise-vagrant) for some details.
